# Apply to tech companies with this CV template

<aside>
👋 Hi!

I've created a CV template based on the latest version of my Resume.

Before writing it this way, I was unsuccessful in sending it to the most important companies in the tech industry. None of them accepted it. The last time I started looking for a new job, I worked on rewriting it and getting feedback from friends and professionals who had experience applying at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, or Google.

This template summarises everything I've learned to write my CV effectively. The main switch of mindset was to start thinking about my career by considering the **business impact** I've had in every experience. By doing this exercise, I not only got my CV accepted but also performed better during the interview process.

<aside>
💡 **How to use this template:** I've annotated each section with callouts like this, having comments with advice to help you with the content, format, and wording. Just Replace the text and remove the callouts to get your final CV!

# FULL NAME

**YOUR ROLE**

<aside>
☝ Full name and surname. Don’t add a picture. Most of the companies prefer it that way, to avoid gender or ethnicity biases. Add the role you’re applying to, how you want to be perceived. For instance: If you’re applying to Senior Software Engineer, put it here. Your job with the CV consists in explaining why you’re capable to perform on that role.

</aside>

Write a short paragraph, aiming to 3-4 lines maximum, explaining who you are, how many years of experience you have and the kind of things you would be able to bring to the company you’re applying to. Use this wisely to highlight your values, principles, achievements and motivations. And really, try to keep it short.

# MOST RECENT WORK EXPERIENCE

<aside>
👇 Add only your most recent and relevant experience(s) by repeating the block below for each one of them. 

For instance. you can skip those 3 months at that company that didn't go so well. You can also skip experiences that don't apply to the role you're applying to. Unless you consider you developed there skills you will apply, obviously.

**Frequently Asked Questions:**
*How many experiences should you include?*
You should only really include detail on roles up to about 10 years old. If you had relevant experience prior than that, you can include a “Previous Experience” section  for relevant roles with dates and titles.

*How long should be my CV?*
Keep it short. Remove any unneeded word. The first page should have your 2-3 most recent experiences. Try to keep it short and direct. The whole CV should be 2 pages max! 3 might be ok, but it’s too much.

## **Your Role** at Company Name

☝ Write your latest role at the company. If you had promotions during your experience at that company, it’s 100% worth to mention it in the accomplishments sections. This will show you’ve had growth while working there.

👇 Keep the details of each experience in one liner. Add it in this order:
1. Start and end date (month and year) of the experience. If this is your current job, skip the end date but say it (Present, current…)
2. Tenure at the role. Many companies like to see easily how much you have in each role.
3. City and country. Especially interesting if you have international experience.
4. Industry or business. For instance: Food delivery, Real Estate, E-commerce, B2C, B2B, Marketing, SaaS…
